## How does DRR work?

Each time you cast your fishing rod there is a chance to consume durability on your gear (rod, chair, float).

There are three separate parts that can affect this chance.

1. [Brand Stone](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/8930)
2. DRR from items
3. DRR from fishing lifeskill level

These three factors are **multiplied** together to form one final chance to consume durability.

## [Brand Stone]($section.id('brand'))

An [Item Brand Stone](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/8930) will reduce your chance to consume durability on the branded item by 50%.

## [DRR from items]($section.id('items'))

The current maximum obtainable DRR from items is **91%**.

For Shai characters this maximum is 81%, since she is missing an awakening weapon outfit skin, which would provide 10%
DRR as **Equip Effect**.

### [Pets]($section.id('pets'))

When getting pets for a DRR setup, you need to look out for their **Talent**.

There are a few pets which can have this DRR talent combined with the **Special: Auto-Fishing Time Reduction**.

## [DRR from lifeskill level]($section.id('lifeskill-level'))

Each lifeskill level will provide 0.5% DRR until the **cap of 60%** DRR at **Guru 20**

## [Putting it together]($section.id('examples'))

### [Calculating Chance to consume Durability]($section.id('calc-chance'))

Let's say you have the following setup:

- Unbranded Rod
- Guru 20
- 91% DRR

This will put your chance to consume durability at 3.6%:

```
(1 âˆ’ 0.6) Ã— (1 âˆ’ 0.91) = 0.036
```

Adding a [Brand Stone](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/8930) to this puts our chance to consume durability at 1.8% (exactly half):

```
0.5 Ã— (1 âˆ’ 0.6) Ã— (1 âˆ’ 0.91) = 0.018
```

### [Calculating Average Casts]($section.id('calc-casts'))

How does this look like for the Grandpa Cron Rod?

It has a maximum durability of **2000**.
So with a chance of **1.8%** this will give us **on average ~111111 casts**:

```
2000 / 0.018 â‰ˆ 111111.1111
```

Without a Brand Stone it will be only 55555 casts, so make sure to brand it!

```
2000 / 0.036 â‰ˆ 55555.5556
```
