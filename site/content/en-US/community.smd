## [About]($section.id('about'))
Hi, I'm Karpfen, someone a bit too obsessed with fish (jokingly, but they really are fun).

This site is built with love using [Zine](https://zine-ssg.io/) and is [hosted by me](https://github.com/karpfediem/fishystuff).
However, much of the content behind it is a huge community effort :P

All the Guides were contributed by community members and the contained information was often gathered collaboratively.

## [Community]($section.id('community'))

### MaoMaoPrince Fishing Community
[Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/xRBqjyQ) to theory-craft, talk about anything fishy or even sharing your recent fishing hauls!
I was told MaoMaoPrince offers free fish upon entering (while stocks last).

### Lifeskill Discord
