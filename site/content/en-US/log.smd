# Website touch up
- General Layout improvements to display more adequate data
- Groundwork done for a Multilingual Website
- DaisyUI + tailwindcss with theme selector

I've finally found some time to do a much needed overhaul.
I do hope the new page layout system will be useful to you.

We also now have the ability to mirror pages to their translated counter-parts. 
So if there is strong demand for a specific language we can hopefully make it happen.

Volunteer work very welcome :)
