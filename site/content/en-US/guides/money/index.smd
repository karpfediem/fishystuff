# Stand around AFK guide

## [Prerequisites]($section.id('prerequisites'))

There are some prerequisites you will want to fullfill before fishing.

Ensure you have:

- ✅ [Fishing level 5](#level)
- ✅ [Maximum Auto-Fishing Reduction](#afr)

If you are fishing with **Rods that cannot be repaired** like the Triple-Float/Grandpa Cron's/Cool Wind Fishing Rod, try
to get the **maximum Durability reduction resistance (DRR)** which currently is 91%.

There is a special guide for [optimizing your DRR](/guides/drr).

### [Fishing level 5]($section.id('level'))

Your Fishing level stat will reduce your bite time by up to 50%.

> Character profile -> Ability -> Fishing

You will **ALWAYS** want fishing level 5.
Fortunately this is very easy to achieve nowadays.
(Often without even having to pay attention to it.)

### [Max Auto-fishing reduction (67%)]($section.id('afr'))

See the interactive [Fishing Calculator](/calculator) or
my [Fishing Time Calculator Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s5eyc9tm5jLNXzPa1VMu0HSOzjDB4Ggcdk7g3iobsI8/edit#gid=0)
Different combinations are possible, but the easy mode TL;DR is

- [Balenos Fishing Rod](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/16162?level=10) (25%)
- T3 or T4/T5 Pet with Special: Auto-Fishing Time Reduction ([Otter](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/pet/56504), [Penguin](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/pet/56401), ...) (25% or 30%)
- Manos Fishing Chair (10%)
- Balacs Lunchbox (7%)

This should bring you to 67% (or 72% with T4/5 pet) Auto-Fishing Time Reduction (AFR) which meets the cap of 67%.

## [More Equipment]($section.id('gear'))

- [Shim Cheong's Miraculous Fish Tank](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/760687/)
- [Archaeologist's Map](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/16019/) (saves you 5mil each time you use Magnus to sell)

### [Mastery]($section.id('mastery'))

As Mastery increases, your chance to catch [prize fish]($link.page('guides/groups').ref('prize')) will increase.
The more mastery you have, the better your income will be.

At 2000 Mastery you have a 5% chance to catch something from the [prize fish]($link.page('guides/groups').ref('prize'))
table.

You should aim for decent mastery (>1500-2000).

The current **softcap** is considered **2000 Mastery**, and your chance at prize fish does not increase as much anymore
after this cap.

#### Quick Recommendations:

- High fishing lifeskill level
- 3x "free" [Floramos accessories](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/697205)
- [Manos](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/705511?level=3)/[Preonne](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/705535?level=2) accessories
- [Manos Fishing Chair](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/705539) & [Clothes](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/705052?level=19)

There is a special [guide to cost-effectively obtain mastery]($link.page('guides/mastery'))

### [Additional Tips]($section.id('tips'))

- [Professional Trader's Clothes](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/14018/) (or [costume](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/14324) version) lets you haggle more
  times, saving some energy and your patience

## [Triple-Float Rods (TFR)]($section.id('tfr'))

To boost your income even further, you can equip a rod with the Triple-Float Rod.
These rods are able to catch **1-4 fish** and have an average of **1.6 fish/cast**.

This means for rods like the [Grandpa Cron](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/767158) & [Cool Wind Fishing Rod](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/item/767187) that they will effectively **increase your total income by 60%!**

It is also possible to fish for long periods of time with a regular TFR ([optimizing your DRR](/guides/drr), [Calculator](/calculator)).
However, the regular Triple-Float Rod, has a limited AFR.
Currently - when using the [Blacksmith's Blessing](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/lightstoneset/30) Lightstone Set - the maximum achievable AFR is 50%.

Theoretically you could achieve 65% when using [Nibbles](https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/lightstoneset/160).
But this will burn through your durability extremely quickly and is an expensive trade-off which is not recommended.


## [How to find a good Location]($section.id('location'))

Since the new prize fish update there are finally some more alternatives to the tried and tested Velia Event Zone.

I will still recommend Velia but if you want to try something fresh, here are some guidelines to look out for in a new
spot:

### ["30/10 Spots"]($section.id('30-10'))

This refers to spots that have a ratio of 30:10 of Yellow Corvina to Blue Bat Stars.

Effectively this means that roughly ~30/41 (~73%) of your prize catches will be Yellow Corvina and ~10/41 (~24%) Blue
Bat Stars.

Compared to other spots - with often >90% Ancient Relic Shards - these have an incredibly high ratio of actual prize
fish in their prize table, which makes fishing here so valuable.

There are only very few other viable spots that are not a "30/10" spot.

### [Trade Distance]($section.id('distance'))

Wherever you are fishing should have traders that are far enough for reaching the Trade Distance Bonus cap of 150%.

For most spots this will mean trading either in the Land of the Morning Light (LoML) or Valencia/Arehaza.

Velia/Coastal Cliff does not meet this criterium, but is otherwise making up for this loss in profit with Silver
Beltfish and Plump Coelacanth.

## [How to stand around AFK (Velia Example)]($section.id('how-to'))

1. Fish in Velia/Coastal Cliff
   > []($image.asset('velia_cc.png'))
   >
   > Make sure your fish origin is Coastal Cliff!

2. Archmap to Velia
3. Go to Magnus at Bartali Farm and teleport to Seoul (Yukjo Street)
   > Optionally: Bukpo for extra distance
4. Channel hop until you get decent prices on prizefish (120-130%) or you get bored
5. Sell fish
6. Teleport back using Archmap
