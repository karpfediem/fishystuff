# [What Are Fishing Zones?]($section.id('zones'))

A **Fishing Zone** is an area where the same types of fish can be caught, meaning it shares the same **loot table**.

The **loot table** determines which fish species are available and the chances of catching each of them.

Interestingly, many **Fishing Zones** consist of multiple separate **areas** that are not physically connected but still
share the same loot table.

### Example: Valencia Sea - Depth 5

The **Valencia Sea - Depth 5** Fishing Zone includes areas that are quite far apart.
One part is located near **Valencia**, while another is all the way west, near **Tigris Island**.

Even though these locations are distant, the **fish available** and their **catch rates** remain exactly the same.

# [What Are Depths?]($section.id('depths'))

Many Fishing Zones have similar names but are distinguished by a **Depth number**.

Each **Depth** represents a separate Fishing Zone with its own loot table.

The **Depth number** increases as you move further from the shore.

- **Higher Depths** generally offer better chances to catch [Rare Fish]($link.page('guides/groups').ref('rare')).
- Depth numbers are mainly used to help us identify and refer to Fishing Zones more easily.

## Example: Zenato Sea Depths

Let's take a look at **Zenato Sea** as an example:

*When you hover over a fishing area (like the green areas in the screenshot), all locations that share the same loot
table will light up on the map.*
