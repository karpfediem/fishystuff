## About
Hi, I'm Karpfen, someone a bit too obsessed with fish (jokingly, but they really are fun).

This site is hosted by me, but a lot of the content behind it is a huge community effort :P

All the Guides were contributed by community members and the contained information was often gathered collaboratively.

## Community

### MaoMaoPrince Fishing Community
[Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/xRBqjyQ) to theory-craft, talk about anything fishy or even sharing your recent fishing hauls!
I was told MaoMaoPrince offers free fish upon entering (while stocks last).

### Lifeskill Discord
