# [Overview]($section.id('overview'))

There are several possible groups to obtain fish from when you catch a fish

| Name     | Typically contains (with exceptions)                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Big      | Blue grade fish                                                      |
| Rare     | Yellow grade fish                                                    |

| Treasure | Discarded Glass Bottle / Silver & Gold Keys / Relics / Laila's Petal |

## [Big Fish]($section.id('big'))

Big fish are typically blue grade fish.

You can affect their rate with the following methods:

| Item                                                                       | Group Bonus |

## [Rare Fish]($section.id('rare'))

Rare fish are typically yellow grade fish.

You can affect their rate with the following methods:

| Item                                                                                  | Group Bonus |

## [Prize Fish]($section.id('prize'))

Prize fish are typically red grade fish, but unfortunately often also Ancient Relic Shards.

Prize fish can only be obtained via Lifeskill Mastery.

# [How does the game determine which fish is caught?]($section.id('group-rates'))

## [Theory]($section.id('theory'))

Personally I believe there are essentially two rolls:

1. First it rolls for the fish group (% determined as seen in the image always normalized to 100% )
2. Then it rolls within that group for the actual fish itself

I believe the game does NOT roll prize fish first, or use a "Roll-Down" Method from all we can tell.

## [Data]($section.id('data'))

Empirical data for this was collected by

- [shrddr](https://discord.com/channels/371035077037129729/371698180405985301/1229359808780566571) [Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Q3nAzy-hYxVIkrEYoWe_wwO1pPMZ3gIVwa43_ONHJY/edit?usp=sharing)
- myself [Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RXWi6l2-7I0AVz42udP_OzjTvGqHF-leODWfnN9Jkwk/edit?gid=147899036#gid=147899036)

  published)

For my own testing i used a consistent setup of 1600 mastery = **4% expected** prize rate with +10% chance to catch rare
fish.
The actual observed prize rate was only **3.55%** in 33.6k samples.
At 99.9% confidence this means the actual rate lies in between +- 0.33% of the observed 3.55%. (So at best 3.88% which
is below 4%).

Another ~9.4k samples were collected by shrddr with +11% big float at 1900 mastery which resulted in **4.07% vs. 4.75%
expected.**

**Negative** samples (no fish modifiers) were collected by shrddr which resulted in

- **4.55% vs. 4.75% expected** at 1900 mastery (17576 samples)
- **4.72% vs. 4.625% expected** at 1850 mastery (10901 samples)

## [Confirmation]($section.id('confirmation'))

According to one Korean player who presented this theory and asked for clarification, they received a response from
Korean customer support confirming that increasing one group's rate means decreasing the rate of another group.

Arguably the translation and or response aren't 100% clear but it at the very least confirms that prize fish rate is
impacted by increases in other group rates.
