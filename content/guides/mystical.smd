# So you want to become a God of Fishing...?

## [Goal]($section.id('goal'))

Collect 5 of the rarest fish in the game to combine them into the Stinky Fish to claim the red colored God of Fishing
title given by this quest: https://bdolytics.com/en/NA/db/quest/1110/1

In this guide I will talk about the best ways to catch the 5 __different__ Mystical Fish you will have to catch.

## [Locations]($section.id('locations'))

Below is a quick rundown on where to catch the Mystical Fish:

1. Margoria South
2. Margoria Central
3. Margoria North
4. Velia Beach/Termian Event spot
5. Hotspot fishing

### [Fish Groups]($section.id('groups'))

The Mystical fish are in a different fishing table depending on the fishing location.

All **Margoria** spots have the Mystical Fish in the Big Fish table.

Using the Ash Tree float in Margoria waters will slightly increase your chance for the Mystical Fish.

The **Velia Beach/Termian Event** spot has the Mystical Fish in the Rare Fish Table. Using the Maple Tree Float will
increase your chance for the Mystical Fish.

This means that for all 4 of those spots mastery will not increase your catchrate, mastery will even slightly decrease
your chance of catching a Mystical Fish.

The **Hotspot** Mystical Fish is the only fish you will have to catch actively and its catchrate is not affected by
mastery or any buffs.

## [Tips]($section.id('tips'))

Some people have issues with boatclipping while fishing Margoria, if you are having the same issues I
recommend fishing on NPC boats like the ones here: https://imgur.com/RtWhuZn

## [Stinky Fish]($section.id('stinky-fish'))

You caught all 5 Mystical Fish? Good job!

Now it is time to bring the fish to Crio in Velia and combine them to obtain the Stinky Fish!
The Stinky Fish has a 24h timer and let's you summon Vell.

After summoning and killing Vell (Vell spawns on all servers), return to land to complete the quest with the Black
Spirit.
